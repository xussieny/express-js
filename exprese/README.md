# Express.js Guide

Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

## Key Features

- **Fast and lightweight**: Minimal overhead for building web servers.
- **Powerful routing**: Define route handlers for various HTTP methods and URLs.
- **Middleware support**: Easily handle requests, responses, and errors.
- **Template engines**: Integrate with popular view engines like Pug, EJS, and Handlebars.
- **Extensible**: Large ecosystem of plugins and middleware.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install express
```

### Creating a Simple Server

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome to Express.js!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running at http://localhost:3000');
});
```

## Common Middleware

- `express.json()` – Parses incoming JSON requests.
- `express.urlencoded()` – Parses URL-encoded bodies.
- `morgan` – HTTP request logger middleware.
- `cors` – Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

## Example: Using Middleware

```js
const express = require('express');
const morgan = require('morgan');
const app = express();

app.use(morgan('dev'));
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ received: req.body });
});
```
